My name is Jane Aristia. I am interested in language processing. 
I am particularly interested in the neurocognitive process underlies it thus
during my PhD I did EEG studies to investigate French agreement processing.

I am also interested in language prediction mechanism. Thanks to this 
mechanism, we can comprehend an input message even before we receive it
entirely.
